# Memory JAR

Works on Chrome with CORS extension turned on to communicate with DB.

CORS Extension that I Used [Link](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf)

DB is hosted in [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com/v2/5f218866c992a7211dbc6fed#/security/database/users)

Backend is Deployed in [Railway](https://railway.app) free Tier

Server is situated in a different [repo](https://github.com/rahilhastu/memory-jar/tree/main/server)

Create a .env file where the server is located with these contents:

> DATABASE_URL=mongodb+srv://[username]:[paswd]@memory-jar.nsd1jfa.mongodb.net/MemoryJar

> PORT=8000
